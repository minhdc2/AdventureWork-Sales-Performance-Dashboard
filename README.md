## Insights

The following insights are noted as viewing the dashboard:

- Around 80% of Sales amount comes from selling bikes (incl Road, Mountain, and Touring bikes). The 4 favorite colors are Black, Silver, Red, and Yellow.

- Retail segment contrinutes to 96% of Adventure Works's profit with the profit margin per order was around 40%. While, the profit margin per order for Reseller was extremely low, at 0.5%. The reason for low profitability of Reseller segment came from the high amount of added cost, which was not Product Standard Cost.

- Over 80% of Sales amount in Retail Segment comes from 4 countries: United States, Australia, United Kingdom, and Germany. While, the main resellers came from United States, and Canada.

- For Retail segment, a customer tend to buy once over the three years, and each order only contains 2 products.

## Recommendations

- Reduce the costs accounted for selling products to Resellers (e.g. optimize logistics)

- Target to other markets such as Europe countries instead of Canada for Reseller segnment because Canada is covered by winter during half of the year, hence, the weather is not ideal for riding bikes.

- Improve customer service to promote cross-selling the complementary products (among about 350 different products) to Retail customers.
